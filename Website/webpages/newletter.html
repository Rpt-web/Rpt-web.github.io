    <h1>VIDEO GAME NEWS</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">Welcome to Video Game News where I do more ranting than an old person talking about the olden days. Anyway, this article will be about Donkey Kong Bananza. Released on July 17, 2025, Donkey Kong Bananza has been said to be one of the best Donkey Kong games ever released with Metacritic rating it a 91%. This game is a switch 2 exclusive and follows Donkey Kong (duh) and a young Pauline travelling underground to get the stolen banana shaped diamonds that the evil apes stole. While I am talking about Donkey Kong Bananza, the speedrun.com world record for the game in 1 player is held by 5eil with a time of 1hr 15 minutes and 53 seconds. The 2 player record is held by 5eil and Jhay with a time of 1hr 17min and 4sec. I will take into account that the number 4 spot is taken by grandpoobear and tinybuttmighty, grandpoobear’s 6 YEAR OLD SON. Having the number 4 spot is good enough but the fact that he did it with his 6 year old son is crazy. Having not played the game yet, I can’t really say much about it but that’s the end of this article.

<h1>THEME PARK INSIDER</h1>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">	Do you like theme parks? Do you like newspapers? (probably not on the second one but still) Then do I have the thing for you. This week's article will be about the many changes coming to Disney World this year and next year and there are a LOT. First of all, the new villains show has come out and it looks AMAZING. The show has three main villains who all make claims for why they are the most misunderstood of all. (Capt. Hook, Maleficent, and Cruella De Vil) Each show has a different ending for each one being crowned as the most misunderstood. A new area for the villains is coming soon but we don’t know when. Next on our list is that Dinoland U.S.A is closing forever and being replaced with a Tropical Americas land that has both Indiana Jones and Encanto. If you are visiting before the end of 2025, make sure to give Dinoland one final visit and ride Dinosaur because you will never be able to again. Next, we have a 2-in-1 with both the closing of the Muppets area where Muppets 3-D used to be, and the opening of a new Monsters INC area set to open in that space. This new Monsters INC area will come with a ride based around that one door scene in the movie. If you thought the Muppets were out of luck, think again because the next change is the Muppets taking over Rock N’ Rollercoaster. No longer starring Aerosmith, no no no, now we got the Muppets. Yay… Anyway the final major change coming to Disney World is that the rivers of America will be closing and replaced by Piston Peak, a cars themed land. This means the closing of Tom Sawyer Island and the riverboat. The final thing I want to cover are the rides that are closing/getting a refurbishment. First up is Big Thunder Mountain Railroad which has been closed since January of this year and doesn’t plan on being open until 2026. The second closing is Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger Spin. You know, that one shooter ride that always has either a 15 minute wait or a 90 minute wait. This one is finally getting refurbished which it has needed for a while now. The third ride I’m covering is Spaceship Earth which I don’t really know why it’s closing nor do I care but it’s closing. Surprise, Surprise. The last ride has already been reopened but I figured that I should cover it anyway, that being TestTrack. It closed a while ago for a total reimagination of the ride and now looks like this(The link doesn't work, oopsie, it's midnight, I don't want to fix it, go look it up)
Skip to 1:40 to see the ride but I think despite my initial reaction to the ride, it definitely is better than the old one, I think the only part I don’t like is the amount of unnecessary scenes like the garage one, I know it fits with the story they are trying to tell but still. 
Subscribe to TPMvids on Youtube, he made the video and he has really good videos in general. That’s the final thing for this article but there is a lot more happening than what I can put into this article.

<h1>Movie Mayhem - The Downfall of Movie Theaters?</h1>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">With streaming services on the rise, we have to begin to ask ourselves, “are movie theaters really worth it?” That is the question I intend to answer today so grab your popcorn because this is gonna be good.
We start with the fact that movie theaters only show new movies while you can watch almost anything on a streaming service. While streaming services don’t usually get new movies until 2-3 months after they come out and have already started to leave theaters, it isn’t that bad of a wait. When you go to a movie theater, you go for the new movie, not for the one that they reshow a million times like Harry Potter. 
	Another factor to take into account is the pricing, a normal netflix subscription costs around $10 dollars a month give or take, while a movie ticket costs $10-20 dollars. The ticket isn’t the only thing that is expensive though. You probably saw this coming from a mile away but the food/drink pricing is INSANE. The popcorn costs like $10 and the drinks are around the same price, like, hello? I could walk up to my local Walgreens and get a 6 pack of popcorn and a liter of coke for like $8. Does this mean that movie theaters are dying? I don’t think so because just being inside a movie theater is way cooler than sitting on your couch. Like, let's take a recent movie like (I can’t believe I'm talking about this movie) K-Pop Demon Hunters. This was a Netflix exclusive but eventually made its way to theaters. It made about 18 million dollars on the opening weekend. Now that might now seem like a lot compared to other movies, but remember, this movie was originally a Netflix exclusive. So 18 million dollars is very good. So, we’re back where we started, are movie theaters officially dead? No, definitely not. That's all I have for this edition.
